# IncrGraph

IncrGraph is an academic, open-source tool designed to enhance the understanding and visualization of incremental programming environments through interactive graphs. This repository includes both the frontend and backend components of the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (v21.4.0 or later)
- npm (v10.7.0 or later)

## Installation

To set up both the frontend and backend environments with all dependencies, run the following command from the root directory:

```npm install```

This command sequentially installs all necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

## Running the Application

To start both the frontend and backend simultaneously during development, use the command:

```npm start```

This utilizes `concurrently` to run both parts of the application in parallel, ensuring they operate in sync for full functionality.

## Building for Production

To build both the frontend and backend for production deployment, use the command:

```npm run build```

This script ensures that both parts are compiled and ready for deployment in a production environment.

## Directories

- **[Frontend](./frontend/README.md)**: Contains the React-based frontend application.
- **[Backend](./backend/README.md)**: Contains the Node.js and Express-based backend application.
