## Directory Structure

- **Controllers**: This directory contains the business logic for handling specific routes. Each controller is responsible for handling a specific route or a group of related routes.

- **Routes**: The routes directory is where you define routes and associate them with controller functions. It acts as a mapping between the incoming requests and the corresponding controller functions.

- **Models**: If you are using a database, this directory is where you define data models. Models represent the structure and behavior of the data in your application. They typically interact with the database to perform CRUD operations.

- **Utilities/Helpers**: The utilities/helpers directory contains functions that support the main logic of your application but don't fit into controllers. These functions can be reused across different parts of your codebase.

- **Middlewares**: The middlewares directory contains reusable functions that can modify request and response objects. Middlewares are often used for tasks like authentication checks, request validation, error handling, and more.

Please note that this is a suggested directory structure and can be customized based on your project's requirements.
