# Frontend

This directory contains the frontend part of the IncrGraph application, built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. The setup is designed to offer a reactive and efficient development environment.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (latest version recommended)
- npm (latest version recommended)

## Installation

To install dependencies, run:
```npm run install:frontend```

## Development

To start the development server, run:
```npm run start:frontend```

This command starts the Vite server, which serves the application on a local development URL, typically `http://localhost:3000`.

## Build

To build the application for production, run:
```npm run build:frontend```

This command compiles the TypeScript and React application into static files in the `dist` directory.

## Testing and Linting

To lint the codebase, run:
```npm run lint```

## Additional Information

- **Configuration**: See `vite.config.ts` for Vite-specific configurations.
- **Environment Variables**: Manage environment variables through `.env` files. See the `.env.example` file for sample configurations.
